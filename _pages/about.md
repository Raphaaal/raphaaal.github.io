I am a Machine Learning Engineer working in R&D, bridging the gap between research and product development. Currently, I work at [Ubisoft](https://ubisoft.com/), where my focus lies in fraud detection within games and transactions.
 
Prior to this, I served as a Data Scientist at [Huawei Research](https://fr.linkedin.com/company/huawei-paris-research-center), where I completed my PhD in Machine Learning for network measurements in collaboration with [Sorbonne University](https://www.sorbonne-universite.fr/en). I have experience in several data-related roles across various company sizes, from startups to large enterprises. I received my academic education at [PSL](https://psl.eu/en), where I was enrolled in work/study programs from BSc to MSc. 

Before venturing into Computer Science, I worked in marketing and analytics. During that time, I played a pivotal role in the growth of [Markentive](https://www.markentive.com/en/), France's leading marketing automation agency, contributing to its expansion from 5 to 30 employees.
