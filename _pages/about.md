I am a data scientist with a PhD in Machine Learning from [Sorbonne University](https://www.sorbonne-universite.fr/en). I worked at [EURECOM](https://www.eurecom.fr/en) lab and [Huaweiâ€™s Paris Research Center](https://fr.linkedin.com/company/huawei-paris-research-center) on AI for computer networks.
 
My background is in Machine / Deep Learning. I graduated from [PSL](https://psl.eu/en), where I was enrolled in work/study programs from BSc to MSc. I held several data positions in multiple companies ranging from start-ups to large corporations.

Before transitioning to Computer Science, I was in marketing and analytics. Back then, I helped build [Markentive](https://www.markentive.com/en/), the French leading marketing automation agency (from 5 to 30 employees).
