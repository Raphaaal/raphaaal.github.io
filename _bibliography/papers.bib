	abstract = {This work presents a generic framework that exploits learning to improve the quality of network measurements. The main idea of this work is to reuse measures collected by the network monitoring tasks to train an ML model that learns some per-flow characteristics and improves the measurement quality re-configuring the memory according to the learned information. We applied this idea to two different monitoring tasks, we identify the main issues related to this approach and we present some preliminary results.},

	abstract = {Learning the right representations from complex input data is the key ability of successful machine learning (ML) models. The latter are often tailored to a specific data modality. For example, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) were designed having sequential data in mind, while convolutional neural networks (CNNs) were designed to exploit spatial correlation in images. Unlike computer vision (CV) and natural language processing (NLP), each of which targets a single well-defined modality, network ML problems often have a mixture of data modalities as input. Yet, instead of exploiting such abundance, practitioners tend to rely on sub-features thereof, reducing the problem to single modality for the sake of simplicity. In this paper, we advocate for exploiting all the modalities naturally present in network data. As a first step, we observe that network data systematically exhibits a mixture of quantities (e.g., measurements), and entities (e.g., IP addresses, names, etc.). Whereas the former are generally well exploited, the latter are often underused or poorly represented (e.g., with one-hot encoding). We propose to systematically leverage language models to learn entity representations, whenever significant sequences of such entities are historically observed. Through two diverse use-cases, we show that such entity encoding can benefit and naturally augment classic quantity-based features.},

	abstract="Emails are more than just a means of communication, as they are a valuable source of information about undocumented business activities and processes. In this paper, we examine a solution that leverages machine learning to i) extract business activities from emails, and ii) construct business process instances, which group together these activities involved in achieving a common goal. In addition, we examine how relational learning can exploit the relationship between sub-problems (i) and (ii) to further improve their results. The research results presented in this paper are reproducible, and the recipe and data sets used are freely available to interested readers.",

	abstract = {Traffic measurements are key for network management as testified by the rich literature from both academia and industry. At their foundation, measurements rely on transformation functions f(x) = y, mapping input traffic data x to an output performance metric y. Yet, common practices adopt a bottom-up design (i.e., metric-based) which leads to (i) invest a lot of efforts into (re)discovering how to perform such mapping and (ii) create specialized solutions. For instance, sketches are a compact way to extract traffic properties (heavy-hitters, super-spreaders, etc.) but require analytical modeling to offer correctness guarantees and careful engineering to enable in-device deployment and network-wide measurements.},
